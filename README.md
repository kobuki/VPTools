VPTools
-------

**NOTE:** All the selectable frequency bands work without issues, but the US band has slight problems. It can be corrected by hand-tuning frequencies and timing, but I intend to fix it in code. To that end, I need a transmitter board on the US band for testing. If anyone has one to lend, can donate or offer one for a good price, contact me in PM on wxforum.net. It can have any faults but the transmitter must work.

VPTools is a Davis(TM) weather station compatible transceiver library. It is a work in progress. It can receive from multiple RF transmitters (ISS, ATK, etc.) It tries to serve as a basis for similar hobby projects. Example sketches provide simple, parseable and RAW packet output among others.

* The ISSRx sketch is a receiver with a simple interface configurable in source code.
* The AnemometerTX sketch is a simple anemometer transmitter for Davis anemometers. It's a work in progress and needs optimisations for low power operation, but can serve as a base for doing so. It can easily be adapted to emulate any Davis transmitter.
* The WxReceiver sketch is a receiver compatible with the [WeeWx driver](https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-meteostick) written by Matthew Wall et al for the Meteostick.
